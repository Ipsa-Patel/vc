            <p><em> Seventh Grader <strong><a href "https://stbasilbasti.online/">St . Basil School </a></strong>Going Girl</em></p>
            <p> Hello! My name is Ipsa Patel. I am a sevent grader at the school <a href = "https://stbasilbasti.online/">St.Basil.</a> My work is to <a href "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study">Study </a>, <a href "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play">Play</a> , <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code">Code</a> and Enjoy normal life as one does. I live in uttar pradesh and have 1 brother and 2 cousins. Thank you and have a nice day ! It was a simple tip of the hat. Grace didn't think that anyone else besides her had even noticed it. It wasn't anything that the average person would notice, let alone remember at the end of the day. That's why it seemed so unbelievable that this little gesture would ultimately change the course of the world.
             Sleep deprivation causes all sorts of challenges and problems. When one doesn’t get enough sleep one’s mind doesn’t work clearly. Studies have shown that after staying awake for 24 hours one’s ability to do simple math is greatly impaired. Driving tired has been shown to be as bad as driving drunk. Moods change, depression, anxiety, and mania can be induced by lack of sleep. As much as people try to do without enough sleep it is a wonder more crazy things don’t happen in this world.</p>
